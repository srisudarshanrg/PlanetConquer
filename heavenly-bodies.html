            <h2>The Solar System</h2>
            <p>The Solar System is a organization of our sun and 8 other planets. The 8 planets - Mercury, Venus, Earth,
                Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune revolve around the sun in elliptical orbits. We will look into
                the sun and each of these planets in detail.</p>

        <div class="mercury">
            <h3>Mercury</h3>
            <p>It is the planet that is closest to the sun. Now you might be thinking... Being the closest to the sun it
                might also be the hottest planet! But that is not the case. Mercury has smouldering days, but it's
                nights are freezing cold as it has no atmosphere to save some of the heat captured in the day. <br> As
                Mercury is the closest to the sun, it has the smallest orbit, which makes it the planet that revolves
                the fastest. <br> Revolution<a href=""><sup>1</sup></a> time: 88 Earth Days <br> Rotation<a
                    href=""><sup>2</sup></a> time: 59 Earth

        <div class="venus">
            <h3>Venus</h3>
            <p>It is the second planet in the solar system and is named after the Roman goddess of beauty because of how
                beautiful it looks when seen from Earth. It is the hottest planet as it has a dense atmosphere mainly
                composed of carbon dioxide, and this traps the sunlight it recieves during the day. <br> It is also
                known as the evening star as it appears very bright when seen from Earth in the evenings. <br>
                Revolution time: 225 Earth Days<br> Rotation time: 243 Earth Days</p>

                SUPPORTS LIFE! 70% of Earth is covered with water while the rest 30% is covered by land. Earth has all
                the features needed for sustaining life! Ample amount of sunlight, plenty of water, surplus of
                resources! We have everything we need! <br> Revolution time: 365/366 days <br> Rotation time: 24 hours

                planet to have life on it as frozen water has been found here. It is completely crater-pocked. <br>
